(* Parallel substitution operation `subst` *)

(* The termination argument uses a lexicographic ordering composed of:
   0) a bit saying whether the expression is a variable or not;
   1) an _undecidable_ well-founded order on substitutions that
      equates all renamings, equates all non-renamings, and makes
      renamings strictly smaller than non-renamings; we write down a
      non-constructive function mapping substitutions (infinite
      objects) to 0 (renaming) or 1 (non-renaming)
   2) the structure of the expression e *)

   The above proof is nice, but you really want to use subst_eabs at the top-level.
