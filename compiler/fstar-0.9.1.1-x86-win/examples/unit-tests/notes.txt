1. does not accept #if directives
-  Let’s use our own simple pre-processor that preserves line numbers by inserting empty lines
[NS] My default working assumption was that we would rely on (gcc -E) for this... i.e., the C preprocessor. That will give us a macro language more powerful than F#'s anyway.
----
2. Does not support attributes [<NoComparison>] or constraints type list ‘a when equality ‘a
-  Extend parser since we will need to reinject in the target code
[NS] Ah ok. This is quite hard to do properly ... since these attributes would then be need to be reflected as constraints in the type system itself. If we are to do this properly, I would want to use the refinement type system to track such constraints. Is this on the critical path?

3. Requires parens in val f: (int * int) -> int 
- To Fix
----

4. type x = byte[] does not work (no abbreviations?)
- To Fix?
[NS] We don't have this particular sugar for array types. You can write (type x = array byte). Supporting the sugar (byte[]) will be hard, because the parser/desugaring will resolve this as (byte List.Nil) ... which is clearly ill-kinded. As a general rule, overloading any symbol across the term/type/kind strata is very difficult to support unambiguously.
----

5. type x; val x = unit -> x does not work (same name cannot be used for val and type)
- Rename functions in source code (this is a programming restriction for F#/OCaml programmers.) Are there similar restrictions on record labels?
----

6. After opening module with type x one cannot declare a new type x (even though they are in different modules)
- To Fix
----

7. Requires semi-colons in records (does not accept light syntax)
- Change source code. In F# files, require #light off in the beginning, if not present, raise an error
----

8. Requires type parameters curried after argument: ‘a list not accepted (‘a,’b) Map not accepted
- Accept list<bytes> and rewrite code to use this style.
- Requires many many changes in miTLS
----

9. decls for infix ops don’t work val (@): list ‘a -> list ‘a -> list ‘a
- Preferred name is op_Concatenate, use that? Support infix funs?
- infix funs would be good.
- [PY] We have a quite brutal approach in EasyCrypt: we have (OP1 ... OP4 of string) as tokens, with OP1 < ... < OP4, and the lexer decides which one to take based on the first letter. What do you think about this ?
----

10. are “exists” and “query” reserved words?
- yes, they are. List.exists? give better warning at least.
- To Fix. Use Exists Forall Query in F*
----

11. how to make a decl for the type System.IO.Stream etc?
- Pattern: Create a shell library for Stream and implement in using F# streams and OCaml streams.
----

12. No capital letters in variable names
- Rename variables to use lower-case names (Restriction for programmers)
----

13. Support byte literals e.g. 16uy
- To Fix
----

14. support if-then without else 
- To Fix
----

15. add sprintf to prims (what type for *printf functions?)
- [NS]
This is tricky. Currently, we just have Util.formatN ... for N in [1..6] or something like that. It's a greatly impoverished version on printf ... but I don't see an easy way of supporting Printf properly in the type system (without adding a bunch of hacks). An alternative is a fully dependently typed printf ... but unleashing that on unsuspecting vanilla ML code will be tricky. In its current state, the tool chain is far from being able to support such a fancy type for printf. Can you switch to using Util.formatN? I have done this pervasively in the compiler itself ... it's a bit painful, but not completely terrible.
- [PY]
What about something in the form:

val format: string -> string list -> string

where "{n}" is replaced by the n-th element of the list (of "" if we overflow). This may be a good tradeoff.

Of maybe something of the form:

type t = String of string | Int of int | User of 'a . ('a -> string) * 'a

val format: string -> t list -> string

16. Parser ambiguity causes if x < 4 then 0 else 1 to raise a syntax error
- fix in parser
