(*
   This development shows how to derive a Dijkstra state monad,
      Deriving.ST.WP    (shortened within this module to just WP)
   from a pre-existing Dijkstra monad of pure computations,
      Prims.PureWP

   The basic idea is to use define a computation type
      DST (a:Type) (wp:WP a)
   using the function type
      m:mem -> PURE (a * mem) (wp m: PureWP (a * mem))

   I.e,. this is the usual implementation of the state monad as a
   state-passing function

   Then, using the given semantics of PureWP, we can just compute
   the definitions of the usual monadic combinators for Deriving.ST.WP. We
   also prove that the resulting construction satisfies the expected monad laws.

             of monotonic_WP from the definition of monotonic_PureWP?
